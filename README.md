## Load Test for Question 2 Endpoint of **/api/Q2/hashReturner**

- All test are done in 3 mins duration.
- Test #1 is a ramp up of user to a max of 60 user until the 2 minute point and then a 1 minute constant 60 user.
- Test #2 is a constant 60 user for 3 minutes.
- Test #4 is also a constant 60 user for 3 minutes.

## Test to show Question 2 Endpoint of **/api/Q2/hashReturner**

- Done using Postman Runner for Functional Test with 3 interations with 1 ms delay.
- Small load test to show as example below.
- From the Debug log, 3 odd number ended Hash were found and marked with number and it will correspond to the results seen in the Run Image.
